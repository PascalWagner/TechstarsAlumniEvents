Love bonding with fellow Techstars entrepreneurs? Us to.

Pascal and Paul in partnership with the Techstars Alumni Board are starting something new, Private Dinners in Denver, Colorado for those in the Techstars network to feel like a tighter knit group.

Intimate dinners are something that has worked well for fostering an active community in the past, and we'd love to build that same community and relationship here with you!

This event is intended for any founders, team members, mentors, investors, and advisors.

➤ Location:
The Grand Denver
1777 Chestnut Place
North Tower Apt #706
Denver, CO 80202

The venue is Pascal's apartment in Downtown Denver right across from Denver's Union Station.

➤ Food:
Be sure to bring a dish of your choice for yourself and to share! If you forget a meal, don't fret, there's a Whole Foods Market across the street to pick something premade up. ;)

➤ Drinks:
Please bring your favorite bottle of wine or a six-pack.

➤ Date & Time:
The event is on Wednesday, August 22nd, and will be starting at 6:00 PM and ending at 9:00 PM. As we all have busy schedules feel free to show up anytime between those hours!

➤ What to do now? :
RSVP "Going" so we can get a head count of those coming to better prepare!

See you on Wednesday, August 22nd!

If you have any questions, feel free to text Pascal at (941)730-8700.

## How to send invitations:
Personally, I’ve had the most success in getting people to attend by personally sending a direct message over Linkedin, Facebook, or email 3-4 weeks before the event is happening. It gives people enough time to put it in their calendar and it also gives you time to circle back before the event to give them a reminder. 

## The message to send:
Subject: Intimate Techstars Dinner August 22nd

Hi Amy, 

In an effort to bring together the Techstars community into a more solid network, I’ve connected with Louis Huynh (Techstars Alumni Director) to start hosting more intimate dinner parties in Colorado to connect with other founders and members in the network. 

I’m hosting a Potluck dinner at my apartment in downtown Denver on August 22nd from 6-10pm and I’d love to see your face there (there should also be ~15-20ish Techstars members there)?

Should I expect you there?


## The follow up message before the event:
Usually the week before I follow up with each person and verify that they are attending. If you send them a message 4 weeks before and they haven’t heard from you, often times people are left wondering if the event is still happening. The message I usually follow up with over Facebook, Email or Linkedin is:

Hey! I’m circling back about the Techstars Potluck dinner on August 22nd. Can I count on you to attend?
