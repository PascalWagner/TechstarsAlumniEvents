# Intimate Dinner Events
The process outlined below will cover everything we've done to make an intimate dinner event a success. This includes everything from the event description, to how to get people to attend, to tips & tricks we've learned along the way. 


## Facebook Event Description

## How to send invitations:
Personally, I’ve had the most success in getting people to attend by personally sending a direct message over Linkedin, Facebook, or email 3-4 weeks before the event is happening. It gives people enough time to put it in their calendar and it also gives you time to circle back before the event to give them a reminder. 

## The message to send:
Subject: Intimate Techstars Dinner August 22nd

Hi Amy, 

In an effort to bring together the Techstars community into a more solid network, I’ve connected with Louis Huynh (Techstars Alumni Director) to start hosting more intimate dinner parties in Colorado to connect with other founders and members in the network. 

I’m hosting a Potluck dinner at my apartment in downtown Denver on August 22nd from 6-10pm and I’d love to see your face there (there should also be ~15-20ish Techstars members there)?

Should I expect you there?


## The follow up message before the event:
Usually the week before I follow up with each person and verify that they are attending. If you send them a message 4 weeks before and they haven’t heard from you, often times people are left wondering if the event is still happening. The message I usually follow up with over Facebook, Email or Linkedin is:

Hey! I’m circling back about the Techstars Potluck dinner on August 22nd. Can I count on you to attend?
